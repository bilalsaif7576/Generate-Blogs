Blog Generation Tool with LLaMA 2
Overview
This project is a blog generation application built using the LLaMA 2 model, Streamlit, and LangChain. It allows users to generate customized blogs for different audiences (Researchers, Data Scientists, Common People) based on a specified topic and word count. The application runs locally on a laptop, utilizing the CTransformers library for efficient model integration.
Features

Customizable Blog Content: Generate blogs tailored for specific audiences with user-defined topics and word limits.
Local Model Execution: Uses LLaMA 2 model (llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin) for on-device processing.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive web-based UI.
Error Handling: Validates inputs and model file paths to ensure smooth operation.

Requirements

Python 3.8+
Virtual environment (recommended)
Dependencies:
streamlit
langchain
langchain-community
ctransformers

Notes

Ensure the LLaMA 2 model file path is correctly set in app.py (default: E:\LLM Project\model\llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin).
The model requires significant computational resources; ensure your laptop has adequate memory and processing power.
Update the model file path in app.py if stored in a different location.
